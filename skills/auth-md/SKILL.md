# auth-md

Generate, validate, and explain the **auth.md** protocol — the open standard that lets AI agents register for services on behalf of users, without signup forms.

---

## Protocol Context

auth.md is a Markdown file published at a service's root (typically `https://service.com/auth.md`) that instructs agents on how to register. It works simultaneously as human-readable documentation and as a discoverable runtime artifact for agents.

The protocol extends RFC 9728 (OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata) with an `agent_auth` block in the Authorization Server metadata, and defines two primary flows:

| Flow | Mechanism | When to use |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| **Agent Verified** | Provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Cursor) signs an ID-JAG asserting user identity. Service verifies signature via JWKS and issues credentials synchronously. | Service already does JIT provisioning from OIDC/SAML; wants zero-friction registration. |
| **User Claimed** | OTP-based. Two entrypoints: *anonymous start* (credential immediately, claim later) or *email required* (no credential until OTP verified). | Agents on platforms that can't mint ID-JAGs; self-serve without trust list. |

### Protocol Endpoints

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` | Discovery — resource metadata (RFC 9728) |
| `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` | Discovery — AS metadata with `agent_auth` block |
| `POST /agent/auth` | Registration — dispatches on `type` field |
| `POST /agent/auth/claim` | Claim initiation (anonymous start only) |
| `POST /agent/auth/claim/complete` | OTP verification |
| `POST /agent/auth/revoke` | Revocation (receives logout tokens from providers) |

### Credential Types

- `access_token` — short-lived, no refresh token, re-register with fresh ID-JAG on expiry
- `api_key` — typically no expiry, subject to revocation

---

## Operation Modes

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `mode` | `generate` | `generate` = create auth.md + metadata; `validate` = check existing auth.md; `explain` = explain the protocol |
| `validation_level` | `basic` | `basic` = structure + fields + consistency (offline); `full` = basic + live endpoint fetch |
| `flows` | `all` | Which flows to include: `agent_verified`, `user_claimed_anonymous`, `user_claimed_email`, `all` |
| `role` | `app` | Perspective: `app` = service accepting registrations; `provider` = platform minting ID-JAGs |

---

## Workflow: Generate

### 1. Scan the codebase

Look for:
- Existing API routes and authentication patterns
- Defined scopes/permissions
- Framework (Express, Django, Rails, FastAPI, NestJS, etc.)
- Base URL and auth server URL configuration
- Existing authentication middleware
- User models and provisioning mechanisms

### 2. Ask the user only what cannot be inferred

- Which flows to support (agent verified, user claimed anonymous, user claimed email, or combination)
- Credential type preference (`api_key`, `access_token`, or both)
- Pre-claim scopes vs post-claim scopes (if anonymous start)
- Trusted agent providers and trust list policy (if agent verified)
- Whether the service already does JIT provisioning or requires manual onboarding
- Desired rate limiting policy

### 3. Generate artifacts

Produce three artifacts:

**a) `auth.md`** — Markdown file following the protocol template (see `references/protocol-template.md`). Must contain:
- Title and intro addressed to the agent
- Step 1 — Discover (two hops: PRM → AS metadata)
- Step 2 — Pick a method (decision tree)
- Step 3 — Register (one subsection per supported method)
- Step 4 — Claim ceremony (if user claimed)
- Step 5 — Use the credential
- Errors (complete table)
- Revocation

**b) `oauth-protected-resource.json`** — JSON for `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`

**c) `oauth-authorization-server.json`** — JSON for `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` with the complete `agent_auth` block

### 4. Generate implementation guidance

"Next Steps" section with:
- How to serve `auth.md` at the domain root
- How to serve metadata at the well-known paths
- How to add `WWW-Authenticate` header to 401 responses
- Endpoint implementation guidance (without generating framework-specific code unless requested)
- Recommended rate limiting configuration
- Recommended audit events
- Security considerations (token hashing, OTP entropy, replay protection)

### 5. Generate Agent Provider guide (if role=provider)

When the user is an agent provider (not an app), generate:
- How to mint audience-specific ID-JAGs
- Token structure (header + payload with required and optional claims)
- How to publish JWKS
- Optionally: how to publish a CIMD (Client ID Metadata Document)
- How to implement revocation (POST logout+jwt)
- How to present consent to the user before asserting identity

---

## Workflow: Validate

### 1. Load the auth.md

From a local file path or URL.

### 2. Run validation at the requested level

**Basic (offline):**
- All required headings present (Step 1–5, Errors, Revocation)
- Service name and base URL declared
- At least one flow documented
- Valid JSON in fenced code blocks for request/response shapes
- Error table with standard error codes
- Consistency: flows in prose match `identity_types_supported` in metadata JSON
- Well-formed URLs in code blocks
- No unreplaced placeholders

**Full (live):**
- All basic checks, plus:
- Fetch `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` from the declared base URL
- Verify `agent_auth` block exists and is consistent with auth.md
- Fetch `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` and verify consistency
- Check that `register_uri`, `claim_uri`, `revocation_uri` respond (accept 400/401/422, reject 404/405)
- Verify API returns 401 with `WWW-Authenticate` containing `resource_metadata`

### 3. Report results

Checklist with ✅/❌ per rule, grouped by category:
- **Structure** — headings and order
- **Fields** — required fields in JSONs
- **Consistency** — cross-references between prose and metadata
- **Format** — valid JSON, valid HTTP, no placeholders
- **Endpoints** (full only) — reachability and correct responses

Include severity: 🔴 Error (agents will fail), 🟡 Warning (degraded experience), 🟢 Info (suggestion).

See `references/validation-rules.md` for the complete ruleset.

---

## Workflow: Explain

When the user wants to understand the protocol without generating or validating:

1. Identify what the user wants to know (overview, specific flow, specific endpoint, security, etc.)
2. Explain using the protocol context above and the references
3. Use text-based sequence diagrams when helpful
4. Point to official documentation when relevant

---

## User Matching and JIT Provisioning

Both flows need to decide which service user a registration represents. Recommended resolution order:

1. **Delegation record match** — if credentials were previously issued for this `(iss, sub)`, route to the same user
2. **Verified email match** — if a user exists with the same verified email, link
3. **Verified phone match** — same pattern
4. **No match → JIT** — create a new user per provisioning policy, or refuse

Reject ID-JAGs with neither a verified email nor a verified phone — there's no basis for matching and no channel for user-facing communications.

---

## Rate Limiting

The `/agent/auth` endpoint is unauthenticated for anonymous registration. Implement two tiers:

1. **Per-IP** (checked first) — prevents a single source from consuming the tenant's budget. Default: 5/hour anonymous, 60/hour identity_assertion.
2. **Per-tenant** (checked second) — global cap across IPs. Default: 100/hour anonymous, 1000/hour identity_assertion.

Use a sliding-window counter with a shared store. Fail open on store errors.

---

## Recommended Audit Events

| Event | When | Data |
|-------|------|------|
| `registration.created` | Successful POST /agent/auth | registration_id, registration_type, iss, sub |
| `claim.requested` | /agent/auth/claim called | registration_id, email |
| `otp.generated` | OTP minted for claim view | registration_id |
| `claim.confirmed` | /agent/auth/claim/complete succeeds | registration_id, claimed_by_user_id |
| `registration.expired` | Unclaimed registration past TTL | registration_id |
| `registration.revoked` | Logout token processed | registration_id, iss, sub |

---

## Security Considerations

- **Token hashing** — `claim_token`, `claim_view_token`, and OTP are bearer secrets with no proof of possession. Store only SHA-256 hashes. Plaintext leaves the server exactly once.
- **OTP entropy + TTL** — use CSPRNG. Default TTL ≤10 min with tight retry limits.
- **Replay protection** — cache `jti` values with TTL of at least `exp - iat` + clock skew (typically 6 min).
- **CIMD resolution** — if `client_id` is a URL, fetch as OAuth Client ID Metadata Document and verify `jwks_uri` matches the one used to verify the signature.
- **Key reuse across claim boundary** — for anonymous, the in-place permission swap means anyone who captured the key pre-claim retains access post-claim. Offer forced-rotation as an opt-in.
- **Bulk revocation** — provide an operator-facing mechanism to revoke all outstanding agent credentials for a tenant in one shot.
