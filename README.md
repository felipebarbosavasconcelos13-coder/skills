# 🧠 Agent Skills by ft.ia.br

A collection of [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) for AI agents (Kiro, Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Code, and others). Each skill is a reusable module that teaches the agent to perform complex tasks with context, structure, and best practices.

Agent Skills are a lightweight, open format for extending AI agent capabilities with specialized knowledge and workflows. Each skill is a folder with a `SKILL.md` file containing metadata and instructions that agents load on demand via progressive disclosure. Learn more at [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io/what-are-skills.md).

### ✍️ Humanizar — AI Text Humanizer for Brazilian Portuguese
Rewrites Brazilian Portuguese text to sound human, natural, and undetectable by AI detection tools. Removes AI slop patterns, restores semantic entropy, and injects voice and personality. Born from the English `humanizer` skill but evolved into something far more complete — with 55+ patterns specific to PT-BR that no other source has cataloged.

**Origin story:** I started from the English [humanizer](https://github.com/blader/humanizer) skill by [@blader](https://github.com/blader) (based on Wikipedia's "Signs of AI writing"), researched what makes AI text detectable specifically in Brazilian Portuguese, discovered there was *zero* consolidated material on PT-BR AI patterns, cataloged 55+ patterns from scratch (including 10 exclusive to Brazilian Portuguese like gerundismo, officialese, and ENEM-style hedging), incorporated the [tropes.fyi](https://tropes.fyi) directory and the concept of [semantic ablation](https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/16/semantic_ablation_ai_writing/) (The Register, 2026), and built a skill that doesn't just remove bad patterns — it restores the entropy that AI strips away.

**Why it's better for PT-BR than the original:**
- 55+ patterns vs 25 (including 10 that only exist in Brazilian Portuguese)
- Semantic entropy restoration with explicit alerts (not just removal)
- 6 voice presets calibrated for Brazilian contexts (crônica, journalistic, academic, corporate, social media, WhatsApp)
- Examples are culturally Brazilian, not translations from English
- Preserves naturalized foreign words (feedback, deploy, churn) — fighting linguistic purism is itself a humanization signal
- Uses the Brazilian *crônica* literary tradition as the gold standard for natural writing

**When to use:** humanize PT-BR text, remove AI slop, rewrite with voice, fix generic/bureaucratic tone, review text from another agent, "tirar cara de IA", "dar vida ao texto".

**Improvements in v1.2 (Jun 2026):**
- Added automatic document type detection with fallback (Step 0.5) — auto-selects the best voice preset
- Added post-rewrite scoring with 5 weighted dimensions (Step 5.5) — quantifiable quality gate
- Added iterative loop with strategy fallback — retries with different approaches when score < 60
- Loop protocol compatible with external orchestrator skills (ralph-wiggum, goal)
- Inspired by [humanize-it](https://github.com/smallnest/goal-workflow/blob/master/skills/humanize-it/SKILL.md) by [@smallnest](https://github.com/smallnest)

### 🔐 auth.md — Agent Authentication Protocol
Generates, validates, and explains [auth.md](https://auth-md.com) files — the open protocol that lets AI agents register for services on behalf of users without signup forms. Supports the Agent Verified flow (ID-JAG identity assertions via trusted providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, Cursor) and the User Claimed flow (OTP-based registration with anonymous start or email required entrypoints). Extends RFC 9728 (Protected Resource Metadata) with CIMD support.

**When to use:** make your app agent-ready by publishing an `auth.md`, generate Protected Resource Metadata and Authorization Server metadata with `agent_auth` block, validate an existing `auth.md` against the protocol spec, implement agent registration endpoints (`/agent/auth`, `/agent/auth/claim`, `/agent/auth/revoke`), understand how the auth.md protocol works, configure ID-JAG verification and trust lists, set up OTP claim ceremonies.

### 📦 OKF — Open Knowledge Format
Create, validate, and enrich [Open Knowledge Format](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/knowledge-catalog/blob/main/okf/SPEC.md) bundles — the open spec (v0.1, announced June 12, 2026 by Sam McVeety & Amir Hormati at Google Cloud) that formalizes the "LLM Wiki" pattern into a portable, interoperable format for organizational knowledge. Markdown files with YAML frontmatter, consumable by any AI agent without SDK. Includes bash validator, conversion guides (Notion, Obsidian, CSV), and integration with Google Cloud Knowledge Catalog via kcmd CLI/MCP.

**When to use:** create OKF bundles, validate conformance, enrich concepts with schema/citations/cross-links, convert existing knowledge (Notion exports, Obsidian vaults, spreadsheets) to OKF, structure a knowledge base for AI agent consumption, generate index.md and log.md files, push bundles to Knowledge Catalog via kcmd.

### 🌐 Website Spec (Offline Edition)
Self-contained offline version of [The Website Specification](https://specification.website/) by Joost de Valk. A platform-agnostic spec of what a good website does — 128 topics across 10 categories (Foundations, SEO, Accessibility, Security, Well-Known URIs, Agent Readiness, Performance, Privacy, Resilience, i18n), each tagged required/recommended/optional/avoid with implementation guidance and verification steps. Designed to run without network access in air-gapped environments, maximum-privacy workflows, and internal projects.

**When to use:** audit a website against web standards, check what is required for production, verify agent readiness, review security headers, run accessibility checks, generate implementation checklists, compare audit results between runs. All content is bundled locally — no external requests needed.

**Update (May 2026) — Full LGPD compliance:**
- Privacy section rewritten for 100% compatibility with Brazil's LGPD (Lei 13.709/2018)
- Covers ANPD's 2026 reorganization (Resolution 33), Brazil-EU mutual adequacy decision (Resolution 32/2026), mandatory SCCs (Resolution 19/2024), opt-in cookie consent model, 15-day DSAR deadline, 3-business-day breach notification, 10 legal bases, DPO/Encarregado requirements, children's data (ECA Digital), and AI/automated decisions (Art. 20)
- All 6 privacy reference files updated: privacy-policy, cookie-consent, data-minimization, global-privacy-control, analytics-privacy, third-party-scripts

### 🛡️ Security Specialist
Full-stack application security agent — performs SAST (static code analysis), DAST (dynamic testing against running apps), threat modeling, vulnerability triage, remediation, and penetration testing. Combines source code review with live testing against local dev servers or production targets for complete evidence correlation.

**When to use:** security scan a repository, review a PR for security issues, build a threat model, triage vulnerability findings, fix a security bug, pentest a web application, validate a security fix, track findings to GitHub/Jira/Linear, generate a security report.

**Key features:**
- **Input-driven SOP**: path only → SAST + dev DAST; path + URL → SAST + dev + prod; URL only → DAST
- **12 steering workflows**: full-scan, diff-review, pentest, hunting, threat-model, attack-paths, discovery, triage, remediation, tracking, validation, reporting
- **6-phase pipeline** (full-scan): Recon → Hunt → Validate → Report → Schema → Verify — with parallel agents and adversarial validation
- **9 attack classes**: Injection, Access Control, Resource/File, Cryptography, Business Logic, Feature Abuse, Chained Attacks, Wildcard, Obvious Things
- **12-angle hunting methodology**: sad path, boundaries, component assumptions, wrong ordering, concurrency, parser disagreements, round-trip fidelity, config control, privilege tracing, leaked context, parameter overrides, unverified claims
- **Adversarial validation**: separate agents try to DISPROVE findings (5 gates: exploitation, impact, baseline, mitigation, parser/runtime)
- **Structured JSON output**: findings.json validated against JSON schema with trace (entrypoint→propagation→sink), conditions, execution, confidence
- **Schema validator**: zero-dependency Node.js script (`validate-findings.cjs`) for CI integration
- **Multi-run additive coverage**: each run targets gaps from prior runs; single run finds ~50% of total vulnerabilities
- **5 utility scripts**: SQLite scan DB, file ranker, report finalizer, pentest automation, schema validator
- **Pentest tool cascade**: nmap → python-nmap → socket scan; nikto → wapiti3 → header checks; gobuster → dirsearch → urllib brute
- **Three-layer correlation**: source finding → dev exploit → prod confirmation
- **Dynamic baseline calibration**: compares patterns against industry-standard comparable applications

**Architecture:**
```
