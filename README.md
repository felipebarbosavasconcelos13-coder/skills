# 🧠 Agent Skills by ft.ia.br

A collection of [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) for AI agents (Kiro, Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Code, and others). Each skill is a reusable module that teaches the agent to perform complex tasks with context, structure, and best practices.

Agent Skills are a lightweight, open format for extending AI agent capabilities with specialized knowledge and workflows. Each skill is a folder with a `SKILL.md` file containing metadata and instructions that agents load on demand via progressive disclosure.

Based on [ralph-loop-kiro-specs](https://github.com/mreferre/ralph-loop-kiro-specs) by [mreferre](https://github.com/mreferre).

**When to use:** automate Kiro spec task implementation, run kiro-cli in a loop, drive a spec to completion through repeated agent iterations, set up or troubleshoot the Ralph Loop workflow, understand progress tracking, corrections, codebase patterns, and the summary dashboard.

### 🔐 auth.md — Agent Authentication Protocol
Generates, validates, and explains [auth.md](https://auth-md.com) files — the open protocol that lets AI agents register for services on behalf of users without signup forms. Supports the Agent Verified flow (ID-JAG identity assertions via trusted providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, Cursor) and the User Claimed flow (OTP-based registration with anonymous start or email required entrypoints). Extends RFC 9728 (Protected Resource Metadata) with CIMD support.

**When to use:** make your app agent-ready by publishing an `auth.md`, generate Protected Resource Metadata and Authorization Server metadata with `agent_auth` block, validate an existing `auth.md` against the protocol spec, implement agent registration endpoints (`/agent/auth`, `/agent/auth/claim`, `/agent/auth/revoke`), understand how the auth.md protocol works, configure ID-JAG verification and trust lists, set up OTP claim ceremonies.
